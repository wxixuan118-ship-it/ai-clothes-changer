# DESIGN.md — "The Ledger", LOUD MODE (v4)

> **SUPERSEDED — Atelier theme (2026-10).** This product (AI Clothes
> Changer) now uses a dark fashion-editorial skin: near-black canvas, soft
> white ink, 1px hairline borders, pill buttons, arch-shaped portraits,
> NO hard offset shadows, Familjen Grotesk for headings, gold sparkle
> ornament. Tokens live in the "Atelier theme" block at the end of
> `src/app/globals.css`; marketing components live in
> `src/components/atelier/`. Where the rules below conflict with that,
> the Atelier theme wins. The loud/ledger rules remain only as history.

An accountant's ledger repainted as a poster wall. v4 keeps the v3.1
grammar — ink borders, hard offset shadows, press physics, the pastel-pop
palette, the coin mascot — and drops the restraint DNA on marketing
surfaces: the page IS the color, the type is huge, and motion is meant to
be noticed. The app stays a working tool: medium-fun, dense data on quiet
surfaces. Every UI decision follows this file. No exceptions without
editing it first.

## Hard rules

1. **Solid color blocking (marketing)** — the section sequence is
   LOCKED (v4.3): yellow hero → ink marquee strip → cream "What is
   this?" → cream "How it works" → cream gallery (3px rules between
   the cream blocks) → mint features → sky agents → cream pricing +
   compare → pink FAQ → ink closing band (light text). Dark mode keeps the same hues,
   deep-muted. Body text ALWAYS sits on solid color at ≥4.5:1 (verified
   below). Panel accents inside a section may NOT repeat the section's
   own bg hue; stickers/badges must contrast their section. NO dot-grid
   behind text — texture only as thin transition strips or inside
   illustrations. Section transitions are straight hard edges with a
   3px ink rule (the two ink blocks separate by being ink). No
   gradients, ever — ONE exception: the skeleton shimmer highlight
   (v4.5), a moving light sweep, not a surface style.
2. **Borders**: marketing base 3px (`border-hard` = `--border-w`), hero
   elements 4px (`border-emph` = `--border-w-emph`); the app keeps 2px.
   Always solid `var(--ink)`.
3. **Shadow tiers, ONE direction (down-right)**: marketing 6/9/12px,
   app 3/5/8px — same three utilities (`shadow-hard-sm`, `shadow-hard`,
   `shadow-hard-lg`) reading scoped variables; the `.loud` marketing
   scope raises them. On the ink closing band, borders and shadows
   invert to canvas — the ONE sanctioned inversion (ink on ink is
   invisible). No blur, no glassmorphism. Press physics: hover
   `translate(-2px,-2px)` + shadow +2px; active `translate(2px,2px)` +
   shadow 0.
4. **Four faces, four jobs**: **Archivo Black** — hero H1 and section
   titles ONLY, uppercase, tight leading, offset-shadow treatment.
   **Bricolage Grotesque 700/800** — subheads and card titles.
   **Instrument Sans** — body/UI. **Martian Mono** — eyebrows, data,
   numbers, code.
5. **Scale**: H1 `clamp(3.5rem → 7rem)`; section titles
   `clamp(2.5rem → 4.5rem)`. Offset shadow = solid `--title-shadow`
   color behind ink text: canvas-colored on pop panels, pop-yellow on
   canvas sections and the ink band.
6. **WORD BUDGETS (hard)**: H1 ≤ 8 words · section titles ≤ 4 words ·
   any paragraph ≤ 18 words · prefer chip rows and 3-word labels over
   sentences. Concrete stays; hype stays banned (no emoji, no "Build
   faster / Ship smarter").
   **Body scale (v4.2)** — marketing runs BIG and INK-FIRST: base body
   18px / weight 500 (set on `.loud`), FULL INK — `--muted-ink` only
   for genuinely secondary lines (captions, legal, timestamps, mono
   metadata, table "no" cells). Hero sub-headline 1.5rem/600.
   Feature-card lines, pricing row copy, FAQ questions + answers:
   1.25rem (questions bold). App surfaces stay 16px, ink-first — muted
   only for metadata and eyebrows. Feature rows
   are six ILLUSTRATED CARDS (v4.2): cream card on the mint block, 3px
   border, md shadow, ±1.5° tilt that straightens on hover, staggered
   pop-in — transparent sticker illustration (~200px) on top, mono
   number chip, 3–4 word Bricolage-800 title with a colored offset
   shadow rotating yellow/sky/pink/mint/orange/yellow, ONE bold ink
   line ≤12 words.
   **Typographic effects (v4.1)**: every section's body copy gets AT
   MOST one of — a marker-highlighted key phrase, a thick ink underline
   doodle, or an inline `chip-mono`. Key numbers ("10 credits",
   "$9/mo") ALWAYS render as mono chips or DigitBoxes. Feature titles:
   Bricolage 800 with an offset shadow in the section accent (the
   accent never repeats the section's own bg hue — mint section →
   yellow accent). Nothing stays a bare gray paragraph. `.marker` and
   `.marker-hover` read `--marker-color` (canvas on yellow, yellow
   elsewhere); `.chip` hover reads `--chip-hover` (sky on the yellow
   hero).
7. **Color roles are strict**: `--action` yellow = primary buttons with
   INK text (ink on yellow always, never yellow text). `--credit` green
   = positive amounts/success ONLY. `--debit` red = negative/
   destructive ONLY. Panels are backgrounds; never panel-colored text.
8. **Structural separation, v4 register**: marketing is LOUD (full-bleed
   panels, giant type, marquee, tilts, entrance choreography). The app
   is MEDIUM-FUN: panel-colored card headers (yellow/mint/sky strips
   with an ink rule) over cream bodies, colored badges, DigitBoxes —
   dense data areas stay quiet. No marquees, no tilts, no doodads
   inside the app. **Calm-register systems (v4.5)**:
   - **Skeletons**: ONE primitive — cream block, 2px ink border at 25%,
     radius matching the element it stands for, one shared 1.2s shimmer
     (static under reduced motion). Every page's `loading.tsx` mirrors
     that page's REAL layout and paddings — nothing jumps on load. No
     per-page skeleton variants.
   - **Buttons**: one physics — rest 2px border + sm shadow; hover 1px
     lift + md shadow; active flat; disabled 50%/no shadow. Busy = the
     label swaps ("Generating…", "Saving…") with the spinning 4-point
     sparkle (0.9s linear, ink) — never a default spinner. Sizes: sm
     36px / md 44px.
   - **Generation tiles**: hover lift + sm shadow; failed = 6px debit
     left border + mono debit "FAILED — credit refunded" + a Try-again
     ghost button that only prefills the prompt; pending = centered
     sparkle spinner.
   - **Page headers**: mono eyebrow + Bricolage 800 title + optional
     right action slot (e.g. the balance chip on Generate). Labels are
     600 ink; the destructive settings zone is framed with a debit
     border.
9. **Ledger identity stays**: ledger rows/tables keep 2px separators
   and mono metadata, all numerals `tabular-nums`. The gallery
   ("Made with it.") is the proof section — six generated posters in
   tilted bordered frames that straighten on hover, caption chips in
   mono. Icons lucide-react; doodads inline SVG; the marquee separator
   glyph ✦ is a sanctioned ornament, not an emoji.
10. **A11y is non-negotiable**: ≥4.5:1 body text on every surface, both
    modes. Focus rings 3px ink offset 2px. `::selection` pop-yellow
    with ink text. The `prefers-reduced-motion` kill switch is absolute.
11. **Motion kit (CSS-first, ≤400ms except the marquee)** — sanctioned:
    - **Marquee ticker** under the hero: 3px rules top/bottom, Archivo
      Black, slow linear loop, pauses on hover, static row under
      reduced motion.
    - **Hero entrance**: H1 words pop in staggered (translate+scale,
      overshoot bezier), illustration drops in with one bounce,
      stickers land last with a wobble.
    - **Scroll pop-ins** via `animation-timeline: view()` (no support →
      visible immediately): translate-up + shadow-grow, staggered.
    - **Hover**: marketing cards tilt ±1deg + lift; the hero
      illustration idles on a slow 4s float (2–3px); FAQ chevrons spin
      90deg on open.
    - **Kept from v3.1**: press physics, balance count-up, marker
      draw-in (nav active + inline emphasis on canvas only), sparkle
      twinkle, toast press-in, `@view-transition`.
    - Loops allowed: marquee, idle float, twinkle. Nothing else loops.
12. **No new UI/animation libraries.** Fonts via `next/font/google`
    only.

## Dark mode — "the same poster at night" (Dark Mode v2)

Dark mode is NOT the light theme with the lights off. It is the same
loud poster printed on dark paper. Three rules:

1. **Saturation survives; large luminous areas do not.** Big surfaces go
   deep and rich (tinted charcoal, never gray, never pure black); small
   elements stay electric.
2. **Every pop color has TWO roles.** SURFACE (`--pop-*`) is
   theme-aware: bright in light, deep tinted charcoal in dark — used for
   section blocking and large fills. BOLD (`--pop-*-bold`) is
   theme-invariant bright saturated fill — buttons, chips, stickers,
   icon plates, the marquee, headline highlights, focus rings, charts —
   and is ALWAYS paired with the fixed `--ink-deep` text token, in both
   themes (this also fixes the latent inversion bug where flipped
   `--ink` landed light text on bright fills).
3. **Hard shadows stay hard.** Shadow tokens keep `var(--ink)`, so on
   dark neutral surfaces the offset shadow is CREAM — the night
   signature. Transparent illustrations get a flat cream
   `drop-shadow` (`.illo`, zero blur) so silhouettes never melt. No
   blur, ever.

Dark canvas is warm espresso-charcoal `oklch(0.16 0.015 80)`; ink is
warm cream `oklch(0.955 0.012 95)` (no glare). Surface tints are
per-hue mixes of canvas toward the bold pop — sky/pink take the most
(deep navy / deep berry, 16%), yellow the least (8% — dark yellow turns
olive; bright yellow ACCENTS carry that section instead). The big ink
blocks (closing band, footer) become elevated `--paper-2` panels via
the `--band-*` tokens — a full-width cream band would be glare. Focus
rings and `::selection` go yellow-bold; loud-section title shadows use
the section's bold pop at night.

## Tokens

Hard-code ONLY these; derive the rest with `color-mix()`.

```css
/* light */
--ink: oklch(0.2 0.02 90);
--canvas: oklch(0.993 0.011 95); /* warm cream ≈ #FFFDF5 */
--pop-yellow: oklch(0.88 0.16 95);
--pop-mint: oklch(0.88 0.13 150);
--pop-sky: oklch(0.86 0.09 230);
--pop-pink: oklch(0.86 0.1 350);
--pop-orange: oklch(0.82 0.13 60);
--credit: oklch(0.75 0.18 150); /* positive amounts / success ONLY */
--debit: oklch(0.62 0.23 27); /* negative / destructive ONLY */
--radius: 12px;

/* dark — charcoal canvas, light ink, panels deep-muted */
--canvas: oklch(0.19 0.02 90);
--ink: oklch(0.95 0.01 90);
--pop-yellow: oklch(0.32 0.07 95);
--pop-mint: oklch(0.32 0.06 150);
--pop-sky: oklch(0.32 0.05 230);
--pop-pink: oklch(0.32 0.05 350);
--pop-orange: oklch(0.32 0.06 60);
--credit: oklch(0.75 0.18 150);
--debit: oklch(0.7 0.2 27);
```

Required derivations:

```css
/* register scoping — app defaults, .loud (marketing <main>) overrides */
--border-w: 2px; /* .loud: 3px */
--border-w-emph: 3px; /* .loud: 4px */

--action: var(--pop-yellow);
--paper-2: color-mix(in oklch, var(--canvas), var(--ink) 5%);
--muted-ink: color-mix(in oklch, var(--ink), var(--canvas) 25%); /* 30% dark */
--on-ink-muted: color-mix(in oklch, var(--canvas), var(--ink) 22%); /* band */
--credit-text: color-mix(in oklch, var(--credit), var(--ink) 45%); /* light */
--debit-text: color-mix(in oklch, var(--debit), var(--ink) 25%); /* light */
--debit-deep: color-mix(in oklch, var(--debit), var(--ink) 30%);
--title-shadow:
  set per section — canvas on pop panels,
  pop-yellow on canvas sections and the ink band.;
```

Contrast (WCAG 2.x, computed — light / dark): ink on canvas 17.8/16.0;
ink as body text on full-bleed panels — yellow 12.6/11.0, mint 13.2/10.7,
sky 12.0/10.9, pink 11.2/11.2; muted-ink on canvas 9.1/7.5 and on panels
worst-case 5.1/5.0; closing band canvas-on-ink 17.8/16.0 and on-ink-muted
≥9; credit-text 5.6 light (raw credit 1.85 — banned as light text),
credit 8.9 dark; debit-text 5.9/6.2. Every body-text pairing ≥4.5.

## Landing composition (locked, v4.1)

Hero (yellow: H1 "A complete AI SaaS. Free.", sub + author line, CTA,
copy chip, illustration cluster + stickers) → marquee (INK strip, light
Archivo) → "WHAT IS THIS?" (canvas: three huge plain-words statements,
each with a proof chip) → "HOW IT WORKS." (canvas: 01 CLONE IT → 02 ADD
YOUR KEYS → 03 SHIP YOUR SAAS, step cards + hand-drawn ink arrows) →
gallery (canvas: "MADE WITH IT.", six tilted poster frames) →
features (mint: "IT HANDLES THE MONEY.", six illustrated cards) → agents
(sky: "BUILT FOR AI AGENTS.", tree + checklist) → pricing (canvas: "PICK
A PLAN.", DigitBoxes prices, MOST POPULAR sticker on Pro) → compare
("FREE VS PRO.") → FAQ (pink: "QUESTIONS.", answers ≤18 words) → closing
band (ink: "CLONE THE LEDGER.", light text).

## Components

- **Button**: ink border (register width), 12px radius, md shadow, press
  physics. Primary = action yellow + ink text. Destructive = debit-deep +
  canvas text. 3px ink focus ring offset 2px everywhere.
- **Card**: app register — cream body, sm shadow, panel-colored header
  strip (yellow/mint/sky) above an ink rule. Marketing register — canvas
  or panel bg, md shadow, tilt hover.
- **Marquee**: full-width, Archivo Black uppercase, ✦ separators.
  Content duplicated exactly 2x; the track animates
  `translateX(0 → -50%)` linear infinite with `will-change: transform`
  so the loop point is invisible; hover pauses via
  `animation-play-state` (no restart jump); reduced motion = static row.
- **Chip** (v4.1 interaction grammar): bordered pill, cream bg; hover
  flips to pop-yellow + `translate(-1px,-1px)` + sm shadow; active
  presses flat. Nav links, footer links, the git-clone copy chip.
  The copy chip is a real button: click copies, flips to pop-mint with
  a check for 1.5s, `aria-live` announces it.
- **Hover rule (v4.1)**: hover motion belongs to INTERACTIVE elements
  only — every link/button responds with lift+shadow or bg-flip+press;
  no underline-only, opacity-only, or color-only hovers. Decorative
  elements (stickers, badges, doodads) do NOT react to hover; wobble is
  entrance choreography only. `.marker-hover` (marker draws in on
  hover) is the grammar for inline author/credit links.
- **Sticker**: pill badge, panel-color bg, static — no hover reaction
  (v4.1). **Doodads / DigitBoxes / Checkbox / Switch / LedgerRow /
  Inputs / Dialog / Menu / Toast**: as v3.1 (tiers read the scoped
  variables). Marketing-only: doodads, stickers, tilts. The squiggle
  underline is retired from the hero (v4.5) — the hero doodad set is
  final: one sparkle + the stickers.
- **IconChip** (v4.3): THE standard marketing list marker — small
  bordered square (2px ink, sm shadow, panel-color bg, lucide icon in
  ink stroke). Plain ✓/·/— glyphs are BANNED in marketing lists.
  Checklist rows nudge right and flip the chip yellow on hover.
- **Illustrations** (`public/illustrations/`, generated by
  `scripts/generate-illustrations.mjs` — parallel, concurrency 4,
  per-file resume): robot-artist hero cluster (idle float), coin mascot
  — ONE character: bare stubby yellow arms/feet, dot eyes, small smile
  — in hello/paint/lost poses, coin stack, and the six gallery
  mini-posters (gallery-01..06, opaque full-bleed, same world as the
  easel painting, ≤120KB). Spots: hero, gallery, dashboard first-run,
  generate empty, 404 + error pages, pricing accent, footer corner
  (mascot-hello, tiny). `next/image`, real alt text, ≤150KB.
- **Footer** (v4.1): full-width ink block — giant Archivo wordmark
  (clamp 3–6rem, yellow offset shadow), link columns as mono chips with
  the nav hover physics, "Built by" marker-hover link, tiny
  mascot-hello, mono copyright line.
- **Logo mark**: ink-ringed pop-yellow coin, SVG — nav, footer, favicon
  (`src/app/icon.svg`).

## Copy

Loud, concrete, few words — the budgets in hard rule 6 are enforced, not
aspirational. Exclamations SPARINGLY (success toasts, one hero moment).
Banned: emoji in copy, hype adjectives, "Build faster / Ship smarter"
phrasing. Every empty, loading, and error state stays informative with a
clear next step; errors are human sentences.
